# Code Refactor Starter Code

# what I have done to the codes
Homework for mod 1 challenge

*I reordered the head section by putting tilte before link tag; and then change the title to match the meaning of the website purpose.

*on the image tag there are "/" in the end which is unnecessary.I took off extra img closing tag for Cost Management. 

*I put on alt attribute on images.

*I had tried to move the background image from CSS to html to implant alt attribute to it. However, it seems going to change some structure and the function which does not seem to match the instruction of the challenge which told us to not mess around the functionings.

*I changed the div tag into nav tag to better describe the section meaning

*I changed main content section from div tag into article tag which describe the purpose of the section.

*I changed the last div into footer tag to symble that is section for footer.

*I changed the div tags into section tag in article

*I eliminated all div tags into some other tags that give meaning for the outline

*I changed last heading in footer into h4 tag

*In the css code, I move the coding that related to article section below the content class. which match the order of the HTML outline.

* I tried to moved whole nav tag section to head section but somehow in the broweser still showing that the nav section still under the body section. So I decide to put it back under body section.
